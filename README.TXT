This is a crude attempt by a novice programmer who barely understands C, to take the original Linux DOOM source code and port it over to SDL for use on modern systems.
This has been done to death before, and far better than it would be possible for me to ever accomplish with my meager skillset.

Expect bugs, glitches, crashing, jank, segmentation faults, and the occasional spark of something resembling coherence; rest assured this is by accident and not design.
